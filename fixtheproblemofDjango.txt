It looks like you're encountering a Python environment corruption issue when trying to use `pipenv`. The key error is:

```
Failed to import encodings module
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'
```

This typically happens when:
1. The virtual environment is corrupted
2. Python can't find its standard libraries
3. There are multiple Python installations conflicting

Here's how to fix this:

### **1. Delete the Corrupted Virtual Environment**
```powershell
pipenv --rm
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "C:\Users\LENOVO\.virtualenvs\activite-*"
```

### **2. Verify Python Installation**
First check your Python installation is healthy:
```powershell
python -c "import encodings; print('Python is working')"
```
If this fails, you may need to reinstall Python.

### **3. Recreate the Virtual Environment**
```powershell
pipenv --python 3.12  # Use your specific Python version
pipenv install django
```

### **4. If Still Failing - Nuclear Option**
1. Completely remove all Python versions from Control Panel
2. Delete these folders:
   - `C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Programs\Python`
   - `C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Roaming\Python`
   - `C:\Users\LENOVO\.virtualenvs`
3. Reinstall Python from python.org (check "Add to PATH")
4. Then:
```powershell
pip install --upgrade pip pipenv
cd your_project
pipenv install django
```

### **Alternative Workaround**
If you need to proceed immediately:
```powershell
python -m venv venv  # Create standard virtualenv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install django
```

The root cause is typically either:
- A corrupted Python installation
- PATH environment variables pointing to wrong locations
- Virtualenv creation issues due to permissions
